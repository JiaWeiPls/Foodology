## Short description

### What's the problem?

With the COVID-19 pandemic upon the world, more people are living, working and studying from home than ever before. Not everyone would, however, be able to cook to live sustainably. Constantly ordering in would also be unhealthy for the average individual, while cooking at home will bring about health benefits as individuals will be able to regulate and control the ingredients they use.

### How can technology help?

.

### The idea

With our app, we aim to provide a fun and engaging experience, essentially cooking for novices. By scanning items from your fridge, simple recipes for one to cook will be suggested, with step-by-step videos and a progress bar to assist in the process.

Designed with pastel colours, our app will also encourage simple enagagement in a community through the ability to leave comments on one's end result.
